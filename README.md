# For-QA-Candidate Shop Testing using Playwright
Project Overview:

This project provides automated tests for WordPress using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), a powerful end-to-end testing framework. The goal is to ensure the correct functionality of various components of the shop such as browsing products, searching items, adding items to the cart, performing checkout, and verifying order confirmation.

The project follows the **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern, promoting clean, maintainable, and scalable test code.
